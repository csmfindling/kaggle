- merge 2 models into 1
- fuel data pipeline
- use lstm as last layer
- use fully convolutional network + convolutional regression network
	1. pretrain fully convolutional using sunnybrook dataset
	2. fine tune using kaggle dataset
- refine cost function (same as the one used in kaggle = discretised pdf + l2 norm (mse) )

Data augmentation

- resize images and targets accordingly
- rotate images
